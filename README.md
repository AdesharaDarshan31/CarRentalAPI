🚗Car Rental Management System

A complete **Car Rental Management System** built using **ASP.NET Core (.NET 8)** with 
**Swagger-based API testing** and a responsive **HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend** served via `wwwroot`.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
| ASP.NET Core (.NET 8) | Backend API |

| Swagger | API Testing |

| HTML / CSS / JS | Frontend UI |

| Entity Framework Core | Database ORM |

| SQL Server | Database |

This project is a complete Car Rental Management System developed using ASP.NET Core (.NET 8) 
for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.

I built a full REST API using ASP.NET Core and tested all endpoints through Swagger, which helped 
me validate CRUD operations such as adding, updating, deleting, and fetching car details.

I used Entity Framework Core to manage the database interactions and created separate controllers 
for different modules like Cars, Bookings, Users, and Contact Messages.

The frontend is fully built inside the wwwroot folder, where I designed responsive web pages such 
as index.html, cars.html, and other pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The JavaScript files communicate with the backend API using the /fetch() method`, which dynamically 
loads data from the API and displays it on the website.

Through this project, I learned how to connect a backend API with a frontend UI, work with Swagger 
for API testing, structure a Visual Studio solution professionally, and manage both API logic and web design in a real-world full-stack application.
